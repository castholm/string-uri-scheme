--- abstract

This document defines string URIs and the "string" URI scheme. A string URI identifies a string contained within the
URI itself and can be used as a method of specifying an arbitrary string in a context where a value conforming to the
generic URI syntax is required.

In addition, this document also defines algorithms for obtaining the character data contained within a string URI and
for determining whether two string URIs are equivalent.
