--- abstract

This document defines string URIs and the "string" URI scheme. A string URI identifies a string contained within the
URI itself and can be used as a method of specifying an arbitrary string in a context where a URI is required.

In addition, this document also defines algorithms for obtaining the string contained within a string URI and for
determining whether two string URIs are equivalent.

# Introduction

TODO Introduction

# Conventions and Definitions

{::boilerplate bcp14-tagged}

# Syntax

Uses the syntax and the "ALPHA" and "DIGIT" rules defined by {{!RFC2234}}.

Uses the "pct-encoded" rule defined by {{!RFC3986}}.

```abnf

string-uri = "string:" string-data *( ALPHA / DIGIT / "-" / "_" / pct-encoded )

```

Additional conformance rules that can not be effectively described in ABNF form are also employed.
