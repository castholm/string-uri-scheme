                        The "string" URI Scheme
                draft-castholm-string-uri-scheme-latest

Abstract

   This document defines string URIs and the "string" URI scheme.  A
   string URI identifies a value (most commonly, but not necessarily, a
   string of characters) from an application-dependent set of values and
   can be used as a method of specifying such a value in a context where
   a URI is required.  String URIs have a strict syntax and well-defined
   rules for processing and determining equivalence that make it simple
   for applications to consume them.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Syntax

   Using ABNF and the "DIGIT" and "ALPHA" rules defined by [RFC2234],
   the syntax of string URIs is defined by the "string-URI" rule defined
   below:

   string-URI = %x73.74.72.69.6E.67 ":" data
   data       = *( DIGIT / ALPHA / "-" / "_" / pct )

   pct        = "%" ( pct-1 / pct-2 / pct-3 / pct-4 )

   pct-1      = %x30-31 hex
              / "2" ( DIGIT / %x41-43 / %x45-46 )
              / "3" %x41-46
              / ( "4" / "6" ) "0"
              / "5" %x42-45
              / "7" %x42-46

   pct-2      = pct-2-1 pct-cont
   pct-2-1    = %x43 ( %x32-39 / %x41-46 )
              / %x44 hex

   pct-3      = pct-3-1-2 pct-cont
   pct-3-1-2  = %x45 ( "0%" %x41-42 hex
                     / ( %x31-39 / %x41-43 / %x45-46 ) pct-cont
                     / %x44 "%" %x38-39 hex
                     )

   pct-4      = pct-4-1-2 pct-cont pct-cont
   pct-4-1-2  = %x46 ( "0%" ( "9" / %x41-42 ) hex
                     / %x31-33 pct-cont
                     / "4%8" hex
                     )

   pct-cont   = "%" ( %x38-39 / %x41-42 ) hex

   hex        = %x30-39 / %x41-46

   The syntax of string URIs can also be described by the following
   POSIX regular expression (whitespace and newlines have only been
   included to improve readability and should be ignored):

   ^string\:(([0-9A-Za-z\-_]|%(
    [01][0-9A-F]
    |2[0-9ABCEF]
    |3[A-F]
    |[46]0
    |5[B-E]
    |7[B-F]
    |(
     (C[2-9A-F]|D[0-9A-F])
     |E(
      0%[AB][0-9A-F]
      |[1-9ABCEF]%[89AB][0-9A-F]
      |D%[89][0-9A-F]
     )
     |F(
      0%[9AB][0-9A-F]
      |[123]%[89AB][0-9A-F]
      |4%8[0-9A-F]
     )%[89AB][0-9A-F]
    )%[89AB][0-9A-F]
   ))*)$

   In slightly less technical terms, the syntax of string URIs can be
   described as follows (non-normative):

   *  The URI must begin with a case-sensitive match for "string" in all
      lowercase immediately followed by a colon (":").

   *  Everything following the colon must only contain the digits 0 to
      9, the letters A to Z in both uppercase and lowercase, the hyphen-
      minus ("-"), the low line ("_") or percent-encoded octets (see
      Section 2.1 of [RFC3986]).

   *  Percent-encoded octets must not use lowercase hexadecimal digits.

   *  Percent-encoded octets must decode to valid UTF-8.

   *  Percent-encoded octets must not decode to 0-9, A-Z (case-
      insensitive), "-" or "_".
