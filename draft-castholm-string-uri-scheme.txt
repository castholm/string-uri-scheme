                        The "string" URI Scheme
                draft-castholm-string-uri-scheme-latest

Abstract

   This document defines string URIs and the "string" URI scheme.  A
   string URI identifies a string contained within the URI itself and
   can be used as a method of specifying an arbitrary string in a
   context where a URI is required.

   In addition, this document also defines algorithms for obtaining the
   string contained within a string URI and for determining whether two
   string URIs are equivalent.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Syntax

   Uses the syntax and the "ALPHA" and "DIGIT" rules defined by
   [RFC2234].

   Uses the "pct-encoded" rule defined by [RFC3986].

   ```abnf

   string-uri = "string:" string-data *( ALPHA / DIGIT / "-" / "_" /
   pct-encoded )

   ```

   Additional conformance rules that can not be effectively described in
   ABNF form are also employed.
